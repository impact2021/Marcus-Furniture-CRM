# FINAL FIX SUMMARY - Radio Button Issue

## What Was Wrong
After clicking a radio button to update status, the page showed a success alert but **did not reload**, leaving the UI in an inconsistent state.

## What I Fixed
Added `location.reload()` after the success alert, exactly like other operations (notes, emails) already do.

## Changed Files
1. **assets/js/scripts.js** - Added page reload after status update
2. **includes/class-hs-crm-admin.php** - Added no-cache headers  
3. **RADIO_BUTTON_FIX.md** - Documentation

## How It Works Now
1. Click radio button → Confirm
2. AJAX updates database
3. Alert: "Status updated successfully"
4. **Page reloads automatically**
5. Fresh data shows correct status everywhere

## That's It
Simple fix. No more cache issues. Page reloads like it should.
